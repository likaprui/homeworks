    <h1><u> Instructions: </u></h1>
<h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with the rack in the upper third of the oven. 
            If you are using a baking stone or baking steel, place it on the top rack. Prepare the dough in step 5.
        </li>

        <li> Place a medium sized bowl in the sink and pour the canned tomatoes, juices and all into the bowl. 
             Chop tomatoes by hand. Spread about ¾ cup tomato sauce evenly over each pizza, leaving about 1 inch around the bare edges.
        </li>

        <li>
            If your mozzarella is packed in water, drain the water and gently pat the mozzarella dry on a clean tea towel or paper towels. 
            If you are working with large mozzarella balls, cut them into smaller 1-inch balls. Spread the mozzarella over the pizza, putting a little extra in the center of the pizza as it melts towards the edges.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake the pizzas individually on the top rack until the crust is golden and the cheese is just golden, about 10 to 12 minutes 
            (or significantly less if you're using a baking stone/steel – keep an eye on it).
        </li>

        <li>
            Top each pizza generously with fresh basil, followed by a drizzle of olive oil, salt and red pepper flakes, if desired. Cut and enjoy. 
            Leftover pizza keeps well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
        </li>
    </ol>
